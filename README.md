# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes. The prediction is based on diagnostic measurements included in a comprehensive dataset. The goal is to develop an accurate predictive model that can assist in the early detection of diabetes.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a `diabetes.csv` file. It contains diagnostic information for Pima Indian women, with the following features:

* **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant.
* **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
* **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
* **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
* **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
* **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/ (height in m)^2).
* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
* **Age:** Age in years.
* **Outcome:** Class variable (0 for non-diabetic, 1 for diabetic).

## **Goals**

1.  To perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
2.  To preprocess the data, including handling missing values and scaling features.
3.  To build and train various machine learning classification models.
4.  To evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics.
5.  To identify the best-performing model for predicting diabetes.

## **Methodology**

### 1. **Data Loading and Initial Inspection**
The project begins by loading the `diabetes.csv` dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Initial steps involve checking for data types, missing values (including implicit '0' values), and getting a statistical summary.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Visualizing the distribution of each feature using histograms.
* Creating a correlation heatmap to understand feature relationships.
* Analyzing the distribution of the `Outcome` variable to check for class imbalance.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
* **Handling Missing Values:** Missing values represented by `0` in key columns (`Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `BMI`, etc.) are identified and imputed, typically with the mean or median.
* **Feature Scaling:** The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to ensure all have a similar scale, which is crucial for distance-based algorithms like KNN and SVM.

### 4. **Model Building and Training**
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The following machine learning models are trained:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
* **Decision Tree**
* **Random Forest**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### 5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
For each model, a hyperparameter tuning technique like Grid Search or Randomized Search is used to find the optimal set of parameters that yield the best performance.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
The performance of each trained model is evaluated on the test set using a variety of metrics:
* **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the predictions.
* **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** Provided by the classification report to handle potential class imbalance.
* **Confusion Matrix:** A visual representation of correct and incorrect predictions.
* **ROC Curve and AUC:** To assess the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

## **Results**

A summary of the performance of each model, along with their respective best hyperparameters and evaluation metrics, will be provided here. The best-performing model is then identified and discussed.

## **Future Enhancements**

* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features from existing ones (e.g., combining BMI and Age) to potentially improve model performance.
* **Ensemble Modeling:** Experimenting with more advanced ensemble techniques like Stacking or Bagging.
* **Pipeline Automation:** Creating an automated scikit-learn pipeline for data preprocessing and model training.

* Python
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
